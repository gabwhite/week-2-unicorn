						<h2> "The future depends entirely on what each of us does every day; a movement is only people moving."</h2>
						<h3>- Gloria Steinem</h3>
						<p>The concept of Cyberfeminism defies a strict definition, and most feminist scholars would define Cyberfeminism as a range of debates, theories, and practices. Cyberfeminism is not a subject, but an approach to a subject such as gender stereotypes in cyberspace and gender equality in cyberspace.</p>

						<h2> What is the Unicorn Law?</h2>
						<h3>Simply put The Unicorn Law suggests that women working in the tech industry are so rare, they're pretty much unicorns. Therefore, going to see a woman speak at a text conference is like seeing a real, live unicorn.</h3>
						<p>Basically, the Unicorn Law suggests that because women are tokenized in the tech industry as "Women in the Tech Industry" they're more likely to gain recognition for being a woman rather than the actual work they're producing.</p>
						<p>This then becomes a double-edged sword: if a woman is invited to a tech conference to speak about being a woman in the tech industry, should she accept the invitation? On the one hand, it's a great opportunity for publicity and networking, but on the other hand she is still enforcing that as a woman in tech, you must talk about being a woman in tech.</p>
